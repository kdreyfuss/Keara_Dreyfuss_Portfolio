CaneEats is a Java-based project built for my BTE324 class. It simulates a simple restaurant ordering system similar to Uber eats but for the University of Miami (hence the name), where users can view menus, place orders, and manage customer data.

Features: 
- Order creation and tracking
- Menu and customer management
- Organized using Java packages and file I/O
