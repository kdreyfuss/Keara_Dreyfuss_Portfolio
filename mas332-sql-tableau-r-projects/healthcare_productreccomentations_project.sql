/* Product Recommendation Engine (Customers Who Bought This Also Bought...) - Builds a basic recommendation system by analyzing co-purchase patterns and calculating how often customers buy pairs of products together.

Steps:
	1. Subquery 1 - Product ID and Units Sold ( to use later as a denominator )
    2. Subquery 2 - JOIN purchases with itself on cust_id, do not keep rows with matching product id's
		- this gives us a product purchased and ANOTHER product purchased
	3. From Subquery 2 - group on Product IDs (first purchase and second purchase) to get "Product" and "Next Product" and counts
    4. JOIN result from 3 with Subquery 1
		- with denominator, calculate frequencies (purchases / total)
