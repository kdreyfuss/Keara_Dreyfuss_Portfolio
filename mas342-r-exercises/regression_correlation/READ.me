This lab explores correlation and linear regression using R. I created scatterplots, calculated correlation coefficients, determined the best fit regression line, and made predictions based on the model. The lab applies these concepts to real-world marketing data and billionaire net worths, demonstrating foundational statistical modeling skills in R.
