## Directions: Workout the problems using R markdown.  Hand in both the \*.rmd file and the knitted \*.pdf file. (3 points for correctly submitting)

#### 1. Job Changes Data with Dummy Variables (2 points each part)

Using the `JobChanges.csv` file, answer the following questions.

  a. Fit a simple linear regression model to predict the annual salary in thousands of USD (`Salary`) as a function of the number of job changes (`Jobs`).  Print a summary of the model.
  
```{r}
df = read.csv("JobChanges.csv") 
reg = lm(Salary ~ Jobs, data = df)
summary(reg)
```

  b. What percent of the variation in `Salary` can be explained by the model in the previous part? 

*24.38% of Variation in Salary can be explained by the model.*

 c. Create a barplot of the 3 education levels in the `Education` variable by passing a `summary` of the Education factor into the `barplot` function.  

```{r}
barplot(summary(factor(df$Education)), ylab = "Frequency", col = "darkblue")
```

  d. Fit a multiple regression model to predict the `Salary` using `Jobs` and 2 dummy variables representing education levels as predictor variables.  Print a summary of the model.

```{r}
reg2 = lm(Salary ~ Education + Jobs, data = df)
summary(reg2)
```

  e. Create a scatterplot of `Jobs` versus `Salary`.  Overlay the scatterplot with the regression line for the `HS` level as given in the previous model.  Also, overlay the scatterplot with the regression lines for the other 2 levels as given by the previous model.

```{r}
plot(df$Salary, df$Jobs, xlab = "Salary", ylab = "Jobs")
abline(a = 42.6046, b = 6.1788, col = "hotpink", lwd = 2) # HS level
abline(a = 76.2162, b = 6.1788, col = "skyblue", lwd = 2) # Master's Degree level
legend('topleft', c('HS', 'Masters'), col = c("red", "blue"), lwd = 2)
```

  f. How should the dummy variables be interpreted?
  
*People with nasters degrees will earn $33,611 more than people with only HS degrees*

#### 2. Job Changes Data with Interactions (2 points each part)

Using the `JobChanges.csv` file, answer the following questions.

 a. Fit a multiple regression model on the data set predicting `Salary` as a function of `Jobs` and `Education`.  Include an interaction between the predictor variables. Print a summary of the model.

```{r}
reg3 = lm(Salary ~ Jobs + Education + Jobs:Education, data = df)
summary(reg3)
```

  b. Interpret the interaction coefficients from the previous model.

*For each job, the salary will be 1,200 less if the education is high school, and 6.137 more if the education is Masters.*

  c. Create a scatterplot of `Jobs` versus `Salary`.  Overlay the scatterplot with the regression line for the `HS` level as given in the previous model.  Also, overlay the scatterplot with the regression lines for the remaining levels as given by the previous model.

```{r}
plot(Salary ~ Jobs, data = df)
abline(a = 50.7179, b = 4.9933, col = "red", lwd = 2) 
abline(a = 50.7179 - 9.3977, b = 4.9933 + 6.1370, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
legend('topleft', c('HS', 'Masters'), col = c("red", "blue"), lwd = 2)
```

 d. Using the multiple regression model with the interaction from part a, specify the simple linear regression equation that predicts `Salary` using `Jobs` as a predictor for high school graduates (`HS`).  Also, specify the same simple linear regressions for college graduates (`bachelors`) and people with a graduate degree (`masters`).

*HS graduates: 
Salary = (50.7179 + 4.9933* Jobs)

Bachelors:
Salary = (50.7179 + 4.9933 * Jobs+ (-1.2001) *Jobs)

Masters: 
Salary = (50.7179 + 4.9933 * Jobs + 6.1370 * Jobs)*

 e. Create and add a variable called `JobsM` which mean-centers the Jobs variable.

```{r}
df$Jobs_MC = df$Jobs - mean(df$Jobs)
summary(df$Jobs_MC)

```

 f. Fit a multiple regression model which uses the following predictors:
 * a dummy variable for observations at the `bachelors` level, 
 * a dummy variable for observations at the `masters` level, 
 * the mean-centered Jobs, and
 * interactions between each dummy variable and the mean-centered Jobs.
 
```{r}
df$Education = factor(df$Education, levels = c("Bachelors", "Masters", "HS"))
reg4 = lm(Salary ~  Jobs_MC + Education + Jobs_MC:Education, data = df)
summary(reg4)

```




## 3. Carseat Sales with Categorical Variables (2 points each part)

Here we will use the car seats data to solve the questions below.  From the `ISLR` package, load in the `Carseats` data by running the code chunk below.

```{r}
library(ISLR)
data(Carseats)
```

  a. Get a summary of the data using the `summary` function. 

```{r}
summary(Carseats)
```

  b. List the variables that are numeric and the variables that are categorical.

*Numerical Variables are Sales, Comprice, Income, Adervistiing, Population, Price, Age, and Education. Categorical variables are ShelveLoc, Urban, and US. *

  c. Generate a linear model to predict the response variable (`Sales`) from all of the other variables in the data set.

```{r}
reg5 = lm(Sales ~ ., data = Carseats)
summary(reg5)

```

  d. Display a summary of the model given from the previous part.

```{r}
summary(reg5)
```
