Newsvendor Simulation â€” Yield Management Under Uncertainty

This Excel-based project models the Newsvendor Problem, simulating profit outcomes across different inventory levels under uncertain demand done in simulation systems class. Using randomly generated demand based on a normal distribution, the simulation helps identify the optimal order quantity that balances overstocking and stockout costs.

Key features:
- 100+ demand simulations
- Profit calculation logic for each scenario
- Summary statistics (mean, std dev, range)
- Visual charts comparing expected profit by quantity
