Monte Carlo Simulation: Stock Price Forecasting

This project simulates future stock prices over 23 trading days using historical return data and Monte Carlo methods.  
It models uncertainty in daily returns using a normal distribution and runs 1,000 simulations to project the stockâ€™s price range done in computer simulation systems course. 
Output details Mean, median, percentiles, and charted price trajectories.
